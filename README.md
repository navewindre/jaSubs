# jaSubs
------------

A "fork" of [InterSubs](https://github.com/oltodosel/interSubs), but for Japanese **only**.

Interactive subtitles for [mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv), that was made to help study Japanese.  
Easily tweaked and customizable.

**NOTE:** This project is unstable as for now and has some bugs
